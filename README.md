## URL Manipulation - Query String Attack
By manipulating certain parts of a URL, a hacker can get a web server to deliver web pages that they are not supposed to have access to.

The data present in the URL is automatically created by the site. When navigating normally, a user simply clicks the links proposed by the website. If a user manually modifies the parameter, they can try different values.

If the designer has not anticipated this possibility, the hacker may potentially obtain access to an area that is usually protected.
